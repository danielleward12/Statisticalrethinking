**Ch. 4**

When setting up a simulation there are 3 main steps: 
1. Think through system 
2. Create estimator 
3. Test estimator

*Types of qâ€™s you can ask with height, weight, and sex*

1.  What is the causal effect of H on W?
2.  What is the causal effect of S on W?
3.  What is the direct causal effect of S on W?

For 2. and 3. you need to stratify by S

*Categorical variables*
- indicator (0/1) variables
- index (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.) variables

Index is better in most cases


Finding the total causal effect requires finding the difference between each group's post posterior distribution
- must use causal contrasting to find the differences 
- you can't just compare the overlap


Then you can show the proportion of one variable that is different from another (ex. what proportion of men are heavier than women?)


To find causal contrasts you need to:
1. compute posterior distribution of each variable using link function
2. find the differences b/w variables' posterior distributions
3. summarize last
